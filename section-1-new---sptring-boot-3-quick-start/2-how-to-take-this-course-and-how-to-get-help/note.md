## How To Take This Course and How To Get Help

### **_How To Take This Course_**

As you go through the course, I highly recommend that you type code
along with me in the videos. This is the best way to learn the material.

Some students will watch the video first and then replay it while typing in
the code. Others like to type along on the first watch. Choose whatever
approach works for you.

But the important thing is that you type in the code. This is the most effective way to really learn the material.

**_How To Get Help_**

If you have any coding questions or have a syntax error, here's how you can get help:

**1. Download the source code.**

If you have any problems, the solution code is [available at github](https://github.com/darbyluv2code/spring-boot-3-spring-6-hibernate-for-beginners).

Download the solution code and then compare your code against the solution code.

**2. Search previous questions**

Most
likely, another student has encountered a similar error in the past.
Use the search box to enter keywords regards your error message and see
if you can find any similar questions/answers.

**3. Post a NEW Question**

If
you are not able to resolve the problem, post a NEW question to the
discussion forum. Don't use this current question ... instead post a NEW
question for your question.

By posting a new question you will get higher visibility and this allows us to track your question efficiently.

Be sure to paste your Java source code along with any relevant config files.

The luv2code team will respond to your question in 24 hours.

**Java Versions**

This
course requires Java 17 or higher. A new version of Java is released
every six months. As a result, your Java version may be slightly
different than what is used in the videos. However, the code will work
as desired unless there are breaking changes.
