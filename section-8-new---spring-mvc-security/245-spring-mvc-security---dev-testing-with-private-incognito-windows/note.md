## 245. Spring MVC Security - Dev Testing with Private/Incognito Windows

#### Notice 
During Dev and testing , you may have noticed an issue 
the user stays logged in !!!!
which is not ideal 

1. add some change on project 
2. when reload the home page, **the user is not forces to re login** 
3. this is only issue during Deb and Testing 
   * not an issue when deployed to Production / Real - Time
